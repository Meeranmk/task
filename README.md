## Mobile Responsiveness

The design is optimized for mobile devices (e.g., iPhone SE at 320px width) with full-width cards to eliminate clear space.
Key adjustments include:

w-full max-w-sm mx-auto sm:max-w-none for card width control.
Reduced padding (p-4 on mobile, sm:p-6 on larger screens).
Mobile dropdown navigation for accessibility.


Test the responsiveness using Chrome DevTools or a mobile emulator.
